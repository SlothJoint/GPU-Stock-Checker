NVIDIA RTX 5090 Stock Checker 🚀

This script checks the NVIDIA store for RTX 5090 availability and sends a notification via Telegram when the GPU is in stock.

🔔 Configuring Notifications

To enable Telegram notifications, you need to set up your own Telegram bot. Follow the instructions here (https://core.telegram.org/bots/tutorial) to create a bot and obtain the required credentials.

🔍 Obtaining the NVIDIA API URL

The script requires the NVIDIA API URL to check stock availability. You can find the necessary stock and purchase links in this GitHub discussion(https://github.com/jef/streetmerchant/issues/4). These links are used in the script on lines 15 and 16.
